## Lesson 9

The letter for **a**lms is <mark>𐑭</mark>.

The letter for **aer**o is <mark>𐑺</mark>. Similar to "early", the first part of this ligature letter does not occur without the following "roe" letter. So it's just always connected with it.

The sound of "aero" is like a longer "edge" `𐑧`. The end of "edge" connects to the beginning of "aero".

```
𐑧𐑺
```

Remember "[throw my hands in the ayer](https://youtu.be/-DsyZdeFjug)". If you struggle with which words are spelled with 𐑺, it could help to think of which words can be overpronounced like ayer (air), hayer (hair), etc.

Now how can you remember which is which? `𐑺 𐑻`??

"Early" looks like a little bucket. `𐑻` The *ear*ly b*ir*d catches the w*or*m in its bucket.

    <p>The early bird catches the worm.</p>

And "Aero" is *aerodynamic* because it has it's arch facing _upwards_, so the air flows over it.

    <p>Air flows over aero because it is aerodynamic.</p>
