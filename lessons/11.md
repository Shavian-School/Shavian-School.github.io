### Singular

### Plurals and Genitive

Both plurals and the genitive case (possessive case) are formed in the same way. You add one of the following to the base: -𐑩𐑟, -𐑟, -𐑕

| pattern | example | 
| --- | --- |
| -𐑩𐑟 | ·𐑤𐑦𐑟𐑩𐑟 𐑮𐑴𐑟𐑩𐑟 |
| -𐑟 | ·𐑕𐑑𐑱𐑕𐑦𐑟 𐑛𐑪𐑜𐑟 |
| -𐑕 | ·𐑡𐑧𐑓𐑕 𐑒𐑨𐑑𐑕 |

Some plurals have irregular formations. They will not change (eg. "deer") or they will change vowels (eg. "men").



Try to guess what this says:

<details>
    <summary>·𐑮𐑴𐑟𐑩𐑟 𐑮𐑴𐑟𐑩𐑟</summary>
    <p>Rosa's roses</p>
</details>

### Irregular plurals

Some English nouns go through vowel changes in order to show plural number:

| pattern | example | 
| --- | --- |
|𐑨->𐑧 | 𐑥𐑨𐑯->𐑥𐑧𐑯 |
|𐑬->𐑲 | 𐑥𐑬𐑕->𐑥𐑲𐑕 |
| 𐑵->𐑰 | 𐑑𐑵𐑔->𐑑𐑰𐑔, 𐑜𐑵𐑕->𐑜𐑰𐑕 |
| 𐑫->𐑰 | 𐑓𐑫𐑑->𐑓𐑰𐑑|
| 𐑓->𐑝𐑟 | 𐑧𐑤𐑓->𐑧𐑤𐑝𐑟, 𐑣𐑵𐑓->𐑣𐑵𐑝𐑟 |
| 𐑦𐑕->𐑰𐑟 | 𐑒𐑮𐑲𐑕𐑦𐑕->𐑒𐑮𐑲𐑕𐑰𐑟, 𐑚𐑱𐑕𐑦𐑕->𐑚𐑱𐑕𐑰𐑟 |

And some nouns don't change at all when plural. For example: 𐑛𐑽, 𐑖𐑰𐑐, 𐑺𐑒𐑮𐑭𐑓𐑑. Only the grammar and context will tell you that these nouns are plural or singular.

## Verbs

### Base forms

### Present Tense

Present tense verbs in the 1st and 2nd person just use the base form of the verb: 𐑚𐑳𐑟, 𐑕𐑑𐑰𐑤, 𐑢𐑷𐑒.

Only in the 3rd person do present tense verbs change. It follows the same pattern as the plurals and genitive case for nouns.

| pattern | example | 
| --- | --- |
| -𐑩𐑟 | 𐑚𐑳𐑟𐑩𐑟 |
| -𐑟 | 𐑕𐑑𐑰𐑤𐑟 |
| -𐑕 | 𐑢𐑷𐑒𐑕 |

<blockquote>
    Now you can see that if you want to make word plural, genitive, or 3rd person present tense, you follow this one pattern.
</blockquote>

### Past Tense

#### Regular (Weak) Verbs

Regular verbs, otherwise known as "weak" verbs, form the past tense by adding one of the following to the base: -𐑩𐑛, -𐑛, -𐑑

<blockquote>
    Notice: See how there is a common pattern in suffixes with the plural/genitive and the weak verb past tense? -schwa+voiced, -voiced, -unvoiced. Three options depending on what "sounds right".
</blockquote>

Added 𐑨𐑛**𐑩𐑛**

Bagged 𐑚𐑧𐑜**𐑛**

Walked 𐑢𐑷𐑒**𐑑**

The present tense for a verb is either the 

| base | suffix | 
| --- | --- |
| 𐑨𐑛 | 𐑩𐑛 |


#### Strong Verbs

Strong Verbs are verbs that form the past tense with common vowel shift patterns.

| pattern | example | 
| --- | --- |
| 𐑲->𐑴 | 𐑼𐑲𐑟 -> 𐑼𐑴𐑟 |
| 𐑱->𐑴 | 𐑚𐑮𐑱𐑒 -> 𐑚𐑮𐑴𐑒 |
| 𐑰->𐑧 | 𐑓𐑰𐑛 -> 𐑓𐑧𐑛 |
| 𐑴->𐑵 | 𐑚𐑤𐑴 -> 𐑚𐑤𐑵 |
