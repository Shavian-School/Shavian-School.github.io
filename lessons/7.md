## Lesson 7

The letter for **g**ill is <mark>𐑜</mark>. It's a deep version of "key". Can you guess why? Put your hand on your vocal chords and say a "k" sound, then say a "guh" sound. Your vocal chords vibrate when you say "gill", so it is a voiced sound and lower.

The letter for **ear**ly is <mark>𐑻</mark>. This is another "ligature" letter like "array" (`𐑼`). You can see that the "roe" `𐑮` is built into the letter. But what is the first part of the letter? It's unknown 🥴

Whatever that first part of the letter is, it is sort of similar to "ago". So we have three vowels that are in this kind of "continuum".

```
   𐑻    𐑩    𐑳
early  ago  up
```

Maybe if you rotate "ago" to the left and duplicate it and add it to itself, and combine it with "roe", you can sort of get "early". 

```
𐑩 + 𐑩 + 𐑮 = 𐑻 ?
```

Anyway, it's basically it's own thing. So don't think too hard on it. English is a weird language, but it's our language and we love it 🤗
