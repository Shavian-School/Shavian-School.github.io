## Lesson 9

The letter for **a**lms is <mark>𐑭</mark>.

The letter for **aer**o is <mark>𐑺</mark>. Similar to "early", this is a *mystery ligature* letter. How can you remember which is which? `𐑺 𐑻`??

"Early" looks like a little bucket. `𐑻` The early bird catches the worm in its bucket.

Also, the sound of "aer" is sort of like 𐑱+𐑼. and that is how the letter is kind of designed to look!

And "Aero" is *aerodynamic* because it has it's arch facing _upwards_, so the air flows over it.
