Now that you have learned the Shavian Alphabet (if you haven't, [please go here and start](https://shavian-school.github.io/index.html?l=0)!), you can read this document to learn English with new eyes. Put on your Shavian goggles and think about how this language really works.

### Singular

### Regular Plurals and Genitive

Both plurals and the genitive case (possessive case) are formed in the same way. You add one of the following to the base: -𐑩𐑟, -𐑟, -𐑕

| pattern | example | 
| --- | --- |
| -𐑩𐑟 | ·𐑤𐑦𐑟𐑩𐑟 𐑮𐑴𐑟𐑩𐑟 |
| -𐑟 | ·𐑕𐑑𐑱𐑕𐑦𐑟 𐑛𐑪𐑜𐑟 |
| -𐑕 | ·𐑡𐑧𐑓𐑕 𐑒𐑨𐑑𐑕 |


An easy way to remember which to use is this: If the previous letter is voiced (𐑚𐑛𐑜𐑝𐑞𐑙) or short (𐑤𐑮𐑥𐑯𐑦𐑰𐑱𐑲𐑩𐑴𐑵𐑬𐑶𐑭𐑷) use <mark>-𐑟</mark>. If the last letter is unvoiced (𐑐𐑑𐑒𐑓𐑔) use <mark>-𐑕</mark>. If the last letter is similar to one of the pattern sounds (𐑕𐑖𐑗𐑟𐑠𐑡 these are called "sibilants"), use <mark>-𐑩𐑟</mark> to distinguish it.


Try to guess what this says:

    <summary>·𐑮𐑴𐑟𐑩𐑟 𐑮𐑴𐑟𐑩𐑟</summary>
    <p>Rosa's roses</p>
</details>

### Irregular plurals

Some English nouns go through vowel changes in order to show plural number:

| pattern | example | 
| --- | --- |
|𐑨->𐑧 | 𐑥𐑨𐑯->𐑥𐑧𐑯 |
|𐑬->𐑲 | 𐑥𐑬𐑕->𐑥𐑲𐑕 |
| 𐑵->𐑰 | 𐑑𐑵𐑔->𐑑𐑰𐑔, 𐑜𐑵𐑕->𐑜𐑰𐑕 |
| 𐑫->𐑰 | 𐑓𐑫𐑑->𐑓𐑰𐑑|
| 𐑓->𐑝𐑟 | 𐑧𐑤𐑓->𐑧𐑤𐑝𐑟, 𐑣𐑵𐑓->𐑣𐑵𐑝𐑟 |
| 𐑦𐑕->𐑰𐑟 | 𐑒𐑮𐑲𐑕𐑦𐑕->𐑒𐑮𐑲𐑕𐑰𐑟, 𐑚𐑱𐑕𐑦𐑕->𐑚𐑱𐑕𐑰𐑟 |

And some nouns don't change at all when plural. For example: 𐑛𐑽, 𐑖𐑰𐑐. Only the grammar and context will tell you that these nouns are plural or singular.

## Verbs

### Base forms

### Present Tense

Present tense verbs in the 1st and 2nd person just use the base form of the verb: 𐑚𐑳𐑟, 𐑕𐑑𐑰𐑤, 𐑢𐑷𐑒.

Only in the 3rd person do present tense verbs change. It follows the same pattern as the plurals and genitive case for nouns.

| pattern | example | 
| --- | --- |
| -𐑩𐑟 | 𐑚𐑳𐑟𐑩𐑟 |
| -𐑟 | 𐑕𐑑𐑰𐑤𐑟 |
| -𐑕 | 𐑢𐑷𐑒𐑕 |

<blockquote>
    Now you can see that if you want to make word plural, genitive, or 3rd person present tense, you follow this one pattern.
</blockquote>

If the previous letter is voiced (𐑚𐑜𐑝𐑞𐑙) or short (𐑤𐑮𐑥𐑯𐑦𐑰𐑱𐑲𐑩𐑴𐑵𐑬𐑶𐑭𐑷) use -𐑛. If the last letter is unvoiced (𐑐𐑒𐑓𐑔) use -𐑑. If the last letter is similar to one of the pattern sounds (𐑑𐑛), use -𐑩𐑛 to distinguish it.

### Past Tense

#### Regular (Weak) Verbs

Regular verbs, otherwise known as "weak" verbs, form the past tense by adding one of the following to the base: -𐑩𐑛, -𐑛, -𐑑

| pattern | example | 
| --- | --- |
| -𐑩𐑛 | 𐑨𐑛**𐑩𐑛** |
| -𐑛 | 𐑚𐑧𐑜**𐑛** |
| -𐑑 | 𐑢𐑷𐑒**𐑑** |

<blockquote>
    See how there is a common pattern in English morphology? Three options depending on what "sounds right": -schwa+voiced, -voiced, -unvoiced.
</blockquote>

#### Strong Verbs

Strong Verbs are verbs that form the past tense with common vowel shift patterns.

| pattern | example | 
| --- | --- |
| 𐑲->𐑴 | 𐑼𐑲𐑟 -> 𐑼𐑴𐑟 |
| 𐑱->𐑴 | 𐑚𐑮𐑱𐑒 -> 𐑚𐑮𐑴𐑒 |
| 𐑰->𐑧 | 𐑓𐑰𐑛 -> 𐑓𐑧𐑛 |
| 𐑴->𐑵 | 𐑚𐑤𐑴 -> 𐑚𐑤𐑵 |
